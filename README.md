# Influencing Tech Culture

You should watch the presentation after it's recorded, but here are the brief notes anyway. For full notes, take a look at the [slide deck](slides.md)

## what is culture


> Culture is the set of stories we tell ourselves about our tribe.

* patterns of behavior
* attitudes toward one another
* perceptions

> "You're a wizard Harry"


## methods

Culture is created and maintained in a few ways:

### startup
* new group with the right people
* unified vision
* examples: new startup, friend group
* con: very difficult to scale

### dictated
* clear vision
* disciplined consistency
* examples: military, classroom
* con: very difficult to change/learn/experiment

### cultivated
* from existing
* check for clear direction
* examples: everywhere
* con: ownership is difficult, pruning the right things is hard

> In the end, all culture is grown and cultivated by those who value it. A healthy culture comes from intentional cultivation.

## elements
How do you cultivate a culture?

* care
  * Why are you doing this?
* consensus
  * You cannot change culture alone.

  * More often than you are comfortable with

  * Until it sticks
  * Until people are sick of hearing it

## steps
How do you make a cultural change?

examples

  * care
  * pick a story that matters to you
  * what story are you changing in the culture?
* validate 
	* consensus
	* ask people
	* is it worth the cost?
  		* someone has to implement it and maintain it, is that you?
	* is it inline with the company direction?
* gather a team
	* consensus
	* you cannot do this alone
	* you need other voices to make a story
* communicate
	* be willing to stick it out
	* tell your team, your lunch group, anyone who will listen
* execute 
	* consistency
	* small steps
	* iterate: learn & repeat
	* be patient

## pitfalls
* impatience
* misalignment 
	* don't clash with management
