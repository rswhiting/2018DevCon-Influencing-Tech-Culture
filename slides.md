## Influencing Tech Culture
#### Robert Whiting

note:
* why I'm not qualified
  * not a professional speaker
  * no psychology, sociology, or managment degree
* why I am
  * worked at company with 
    * 3 people - tiny companies have a culture
    * 3,000 people - possible to change culture
    * 300,000 people - positive even when big
    * now 700 people - I can change it
  * change that worked, and that didn't
